# BlackKingdomGameDemo
A simple text-game RPG

How to play:

Download the .exe file to your machine.
This will run a Python script in your terminal in which the game is played.

The terminal will prompt you for actions to take which are inputs from your keyboard.

I swear this isn't a virus, I am merely too lazy to port this over to a non-executable play format.
