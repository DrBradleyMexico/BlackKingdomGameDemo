A simple text-game RPG


How to install:

Download the .exe file to your machine. Double-clicking this will run a Python script in your terminal in which the game is played.

The terminal will prompt you for actions to take which are inputs from your keyboard.

I swear this isn't a virus, I am merely too lazy to port this over to a non-executable play format at this time. Just tell Windows Defender to shut it and run it anyway.

Raw Python file included if you wanna mess around with it.

I made this when just learning to code so there's approximately 1 trillion efficiencies to be made.
