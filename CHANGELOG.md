### Changed

## [BK_Demo] - 2024-11-24

- Changed leveling system to loop, allowing multiple level-ups if experience thresholds are exceeded. I.e. if a character gains 800 exp, they will level up three times from level 1, instead of only getting one level up.
- Added color and format for item gains and experience gains to add excitement.
- Added abbreviations for user commands to increase flexibility of user inputs
- Dialogue and narration can now be skipped by hitting spacebar while in process.
- Added exp totals to character stats in inventory so players can see how much exp they currently have.
